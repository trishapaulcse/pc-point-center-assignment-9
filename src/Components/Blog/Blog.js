                        Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree. As the tradition here, we will be working with a project where we have the global data (in the parent component) being accessed by its children component through the props.There is another thing is render in reaxt context API.Every time the Provider Component renders, the value prop of its Context object may trigger a re-render of the component tree just as if it had passed a different prop to one of its child components.

                        One of the most important features of HTML5 is its semantics.Semantic HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages.Semantic HTML tags provide information about the contents of those tags that goes beyond just how they look on a page.Semantic Html elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human and machine readable way.Itâ€™s better for Search Engine Optimization.It provides screen readers with information.As a semantic tag typically contains below information :

                        .authorship information

                        .copyright information

                        .contact information

                        .sitemap

                        .back to top links

                        .related documents.An important principle in web design is the idea of using HTML elements to indicate what they actually are, rather than how they may appear in the browser by default. This is known as using semantic HTML.
