                <p>

                    Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree. As the tradition here, we will be working with a project where we have the global data (in the parent component) being accessed by its children component through the props.
